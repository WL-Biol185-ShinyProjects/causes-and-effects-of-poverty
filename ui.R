                          the resources and basic needs to live a minimally decent life. 
                          It is a pervasive issue with deep social, economic, and health 
                          implications, impacting millions of individuals and families in 
                          the United States. Poverty affects peopleâ€™s abilities to access 
                          adequate food, shelter, healthcare, and education, creating 
                          barriers that can trap individuals in cycles of deprivation. 
                          In 2023, the United States official poverty rate was 11.1% which 
                          is about 36.8 million people with significant disparities along 
                          racial and geographic lines. One common belief is that poverty is
                          dependent on income, but there are many other factors that can 
                          influence poverty like education, health care, and demographics. 
                          Addressing poverty is crucial to enhance overall societal welfare
                          by reducing healthcare costs, crime, and improving social cohesion.")
